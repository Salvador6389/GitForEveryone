BEFORE TO START
    We need to follow the next steps.
    1.- Intall Git in your OS.
    2.- Intall Visual Studio Code. (Code editor)
    3.- Be sure you know the command line and basic commands.
    4.- Configure Git with your email and name
        git config                                                  - you will seee all the options that git has
        git config --list                                           - you will se the default configuration
        git config --list --show-origin                             - for advance configuration
        git config --global user.name "Jesus Rios"                  - define your name

    5.- Be aware of this concept in Git.
        You have 3 different concepts in local Git.

        Directory               Staging             Repository

        directory: It is the current directory in our local machine.
        staging: It is the place in RAM where you are going to add your changes at first.
        repository: (/.git/) repository
